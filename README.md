# ScapegoatTree
SGT Kotlin implementation

A ScapegoatTree is a BinarySearchTree that, in addition to keeping track of the number, n, of nodes in the tree also keeps a counter, q, that maintains an upper-bound on the number of nodes.
At all times, n and q obey the following inequalities:
q/2 ≤ n ≤q.
